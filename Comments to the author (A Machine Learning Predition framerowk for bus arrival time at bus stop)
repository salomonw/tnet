Comments to the author
======================

- The paper presents a method for estimating the arrival time 
of a bus to it's next bus station. In order to estimate such 
value the authors present a Machine Learning Method (FNNRW) which
uses as inputs historical speed profiles of the target bus and 
the arrival time of the last preceding bus to the target station.
The paper presents a real case using 6-days of data for a university
bus in NTU, Singapore.  
In general, the article is difficult to follow and contains many
english mistakes.  Additonaly, it does not provide a benchmark or
an argument to state why this methodology is better than the 
state-of-the-art.

- MAJOR COMMENTS
-- The article motivates the idea of estimating bus arrival times by 
considering congested and dynamic networks. Most of the literature, 
deals with this issue by using the available real-time information 
of the traffic conditions. This helps the predictor to adjust for 
outliers and new dynamics in the network. The approach used in this
paper does not uses this information. It uses historical data exclusively.
The limitation relies that the authors does not provide any evidence, 
argument or discussion on comparying their method to any other. Hence
it is impossible to evaluate if this methodology performs better than 
others. 
-- Since there is no benchmark, there is no intuition if the estimated
errors are good or bad. Additionaly, the axis of the plots as timestamps
do not give the reader a fully understanding of their meaning. Please provide
better explainantion and notation on the graphs. 
-- Equation 6 should be a weighted average, should't be divided by 3 


- MINOR COMMENTS
-- The sybol L is used for two different purposes: hidden neurons 
and the route set.
-- Improve english on the first paragraph of the II. Methodology
section. The research question is not clear. 
-- In fig.2 the output goes up to M not to m
-- Improve english in II.A first bullet
-- Bad notation $T(L,a,i)^k$ should be $T_{(L,a,i)}^k$ in line 5 and
12 on page 5
